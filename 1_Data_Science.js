Data science - Is a process of getting insighs from data using technology


You dont need machine learning and deep lerning to be a data scientist ---> You can do data science in excel ,by getting insings from bar chats in excel. That is what people used to do in the past
But in the last few years , the volum of data has increased too much because of evolution of internet, smart devices and social media. So microsoft excel can not work on this large valum of data, because that data is no longer data , it is BIG DATA.
For big data , you need advanced technology and tools such as
        Python and R                       - Languages Data scientis use to perform data analisis 
        Apache haddop and Apache spark     - For data storage and distributed computing
        matplotlib,powerBI,tableau,jupiter - For data visuslaization
        TensorFlow,pytorch, sckit          - For deep leraning

These technologies and tools help you analize and get insights from big data in a convenient way.

  DATA SCEIENCE PROCESS


1.Understand the bussines problem

2.Data collection

3.Data Cleaning and Exploaration

4.Build a model -machine leraning

5.Deeploy and collect insigts from model- The model could be doing predictive analis like deciding price of inventorut, user recommendations,product and video recomendations
